    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Who I Am</h3>

    <p>Hello! My name is De-fault7910 and I'm learning web development. This is my very first portfolio website, built from scratch using HTML.</p>

    <p>I'm currently studying software engineering and I'm passionate about creating clean, functional, and beautiful web pages.</p>

    <p>Every journey begins with a single step — this website is mine. I'm excited to keep improving my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond!</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore and come back as I add more projects and features.</p>

    <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
    <p>I'm proud to be part of the ALX community — here's their logo:</p>
